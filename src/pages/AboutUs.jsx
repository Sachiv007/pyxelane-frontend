      <h1>About Pyxelane</h1>
<p>
  Founded on <strong>September 17, 2025</strong>, by <strong>Sachiv Ray</strong> at the young age of 15, our platform was created with one clear vision: to make selling online simple, accessible, and community-driven.
</p>
<p>
  This is not just another marketplace—it’s a place where sellers and buyers connect, share, and grow together. We believe that behind every product is a story, and behind every seller is a dream worth supporting. That’s why we’ve built a space where creativity and entrepreneurship can thrive.
</p>
<p>
  Selling on our platform is completely free, and we only take a small <strong>8% commission</strong> on each sale. This ensures that our sellers keep the majority of their earnings while still benefiting from the tools, exposure, and support our community provides.
</p>
<p>
  Our mission is to empower individuals, creators, and small businesses to reach new heights without the burden of high fees or complicated processes. Whether you’re here to sell your products or discover unique finds, you’re part of a growing community that values trust, innovation, and collaboration.
</p>
<p>
  Welcome to our platform—<br></br>
  A marketplace, a community, and a movement.
